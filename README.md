# Introduction  
Implementing various rl algorithms for solving the [LunarLander-v2](https://gym.openai.com/envs/LunarLander-v2/) OpenAI Gym
environment. For the time being, there are implementations for:  
1. Monte-Carlo 
2. Sarsa
3. Q-learning
4. DQN

# Training Clips
Below, you can find some training clips for each agent. These are captured
towards the end of the training phase (~10000 epsiodes). A random agent is also
provided for comparison:
